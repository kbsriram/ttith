#Privacy in Today in Tech History

Simple - the app shows no ads, and requests no permissions. It will
not (and cannot) export any personal information from your device, nor
will it track your usage in any way.

The source code is fully open, so if you're technically inclined, you
can [poke around it](https://github.com/kbsriram/ttith) as well.

Enjoy!
