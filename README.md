# Today in Tech History

A small android app that shows daily entries from [A Chronology of
Tech History](https://archive.org/details/ChronologyOfTechHistory) by
[Tom Merritt](http://www.tommerritt.com), a list of interesting tech
events for each day of the year.

It's pretty simple - the app shows the current day's entries in a
list, or in a flash-card style widget. Clicking on an entry in either
case launches a browser to the cited link.

You can find a
[ready-to-install](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kbsriram.ttith.android) version of this app at the Google Play Store.
